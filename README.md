Electronic Health Certificates
The following requirements and principles have been used when designing the Electronic Health Certificate (HCERT):
- Electronic Health Certificates shall be carried by the holder and must have the ability to be securely validated off-line (using strong and proven cryptographic primitives).
- Use an encoding which is as compact as practically possible whilst ensuring reliable decoding using optical means.
- Use existing, proven and modern open standards, with running code available (when possible) for all common platforms and operating environments to limit implementation efforts and minimise risk of interoperability issues.
- When existing standards do not exist, define and test new mechanisms based on existing mechanisms and ensure running code exists.
- Ensure compatibility with existing systems for optical decoding.
